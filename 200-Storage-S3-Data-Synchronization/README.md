# Synchronize Offline Data storage with S3

## 🔥 Scenario

Your customer is a printing shop and they collect data from 3rd parties which land in a S3 bucket. They would like to just have a reliable local mount or smb share that would let them get to these files locally in their printing facility.

They are using file gateway now but they are having issues with cache retrieve call limits. They are asking you to recommend a better solution, as they are looking to move away from file gateway.

## 📋 Next Steps

1. What actions will you take?
1. How will you test your solution?
1. Can you automate its deployment and improve its re-usability as a bonus feature?

## 🎯Solutions

Can we use AWS DataSync
