# Threat Modeling Activities

I was asked by my manager to implement Threat modeling Assement for web Applications.

### Introduction

Threat modelingis a collection of techniques that help us bring structure to analysis of systems to anticipate what might go worng and address it earlier in the engineering process. it will provide a guidlines to Architects, designers and reviewers for Applications.

### Audience for Threat modeling

- Designers and architects
- Assessors: Security Accessors who are responsible for creating and analyzing all components in whole application.

### Threat Modeling Process

It is imporment to identify Security and complience requrents and Business requrements of an organization.

1. Identify application design
1. Review the application design document
1. Create design documents (if there is no document is created)
1. Decompose the Application
1. Identify the Threats
1. Document the Threats
1. Rate the threats

### Inputs

The following documents are needed as inputs to the threat modeling activity:

- Capture the request
- Security requirements
- Functional specifications
- Architecture and design diagrams and documents

### Outputs

- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) describing the components/subsystems of the product's architecture
- Threat Modelling Report
- Prioritized design flaws and mitigations
