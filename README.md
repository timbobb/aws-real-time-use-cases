### Generic Guidance

A very broad guidance on the `difficulty level` on the topics. These are not written on stone, more like lines on shifting sands, can be very subjective depending upon the audience and the ecosystem.

- `100`: Introductory and overview.
- `200`: Intermediate level, requires specific details about the topic.
- `300`: Advanced level, requires in-depth understanding of features.
- `400`: Expert level requires expert-to-expert interaction & coverage of specialized deep-dives into specific topics.
- `500`: Thought Leadership
- Anything more than should be _Zen Mode_ or _God Mode_ what do you say?

### ‚úèÔ∏è Tips on writing good use-cases

- **Titles** - Make your titles succinct, informative, compelling, and written with the audience in mind
  - Keep it to a single line
  - Use Keywords(not jargons) and verbs
- Structure your use-case into 3 segments
  - **Beginning**
    - Introduce who (or your organisation) you are
    - Describe the business challenge
    - Explain the impact of the challenge
  - **Middle/Solution**
    - Describe the technical challenge
    - Describe the plan
    - Explain(if possible) what were the choices and trade-offs
  - **End/Conclusion**
    - Give usecase examples
    - Describe technical & business benefits
    - Explain how this solution can be extended or future roadmap
- Use fewer than 35 words per sentence.
  - Instead of, _due to the fact that_ use _because_
  - Instead of, _totally lacked the ability to_ use _could not_
- Replace _adjectives_ with _data_
  - Instead of, _We made the performance much faster_ use _We reduced server side latency from `10mn` to `1ms`_
- Quantify success criteria; Eliminate vague/opaque words
  - Instead of, _nearly all customers_ use _`83%` of the premium members_
  - Instead of, _significantly better_ use _NPS `6.5 (+25% YoY)`_
- Does your use-case clear the _so what_ check?
