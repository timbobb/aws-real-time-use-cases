# DynamoDB Database Schema Design

## Scenario

Your client plans to use chat bot to provide a 24x7 digital experience to his customers. They want to store all the queries made to the chat bot. They want to be able to find out which users are asking which queries. Sample insights the client is expecting from this data are,

- `User A` wants to know about `Service A`, `Service D` and `Service N`
- `User B` is interested only in `Service C`
- Top `N` queries made by all users
- Top `N` queries made by `User x`
- `Min`, `Avg`, `Max` queries for `N` time period
