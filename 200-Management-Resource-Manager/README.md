# Identify & Visualize All AWS Resources

## 🔥 Scenario

Mystique Corporation has 100+ AWS accounts and they have just started their cloud migration journey and they expect this to grow significantly. They find it difficult to track resources across different accounts.

As of now they using bespoke scripts to try to view and manage all of their AWS resources in one place. Since they are the ones that have created their own scripts they also have to manage updating and verification of these scripts. This process is not scaling well very well across multiple accounts, regions and resources.

They would like to have better visibility over who has access to what across accounts and which regions and on what resources. A centralized dashboard for Mystique Corporation to view and manage all of their AWS resources, will be a significant improvement on governance from an operational and security perspective

As their cloud consultant can you suggest them a solution to for a smoother migration that does not require any application code changes?
