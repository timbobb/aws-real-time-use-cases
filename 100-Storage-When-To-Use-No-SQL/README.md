# Why are we not using NoSQL

## 🔥 Scenario

After attending a recent tech conference, your manager is asking you to prepare a solution to migrate your legacy database into a NoSQL database. He was informed in the conference that NoSQL is highly performant and its horizontal scalability potentially alleviate their current problems.

What is your plan to deal with this scenario?

## 🎯Solutions

You could prepare a solution brief with the following information to guide the conversation and choose the database that fits your application needs.

### Database Use cases and Common access patterns

1. #### Relational Database

    Your customer needs to maintain referential integrity and consistency with their data.
    >_For example_, transactional systems need databases that can store something in a single place and have high integrity.

1. #### Key-value

    Your customer needs consistent performance at massive scale.

    >_For example_, applications like video games or mobile apps need databases that can operate extremely fast regardless if they had 10 users or a hundred million users.

1. #### Wide-Column

    Your customer needs to store large amounts of data with virtually unlimited scalability.
    >_For example_, Industrial equipment maintenance, fleet management, and route optimization need this type of database.

1. #### Document

    Your customer needs to store semi-structured data as documents.
    >_For example_, applications for content management, personalization, and mobile applications need this type of database.

1. #### In-memory

    Your customer’s applications require real time sub-millisecond latency access to data.
    >_For example_ applications that need caching, gaming leaderboards, and real-time analytics need this type of database.

1. #### Graph

    Your customer has datasets that are really large and have a lot of interconnectedness.
    >_For example_, applications for fraud detection, social networking, and product recommendations need this type of database.

1. #### Time-series

    Your customer wants applications to efficiently collect, synthesize, and derive insights from enormous amounts of data that changes over time.
    >_For example_, IoT applications would want to use a time-series database.

1. #### Ledger

    Your customer wants data that is immutable or can’t be changed, and that is cryptographically verifiable.
    >_For example_, applications for supply chain, healthcare, and DMVs need this type of database.
