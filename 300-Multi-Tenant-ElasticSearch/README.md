# Multi-Tenant ElasticSearch Cluster

## 🔥 Scenario

Your client is building a SaaS platform and want their customers access to the logs hosted in elasticsearch. They want you to design a solution that will host indexes of multiple tenants in elasticsearch. They are medium sized company and do not have a lot of customers at this moment. Each of their customer indexes will be less than 50GB/month. They have approximately 100 customers and expect to grow more in future.

What is your recommendation solution for hosting multi-tenants in AWS ElasticSearch?
