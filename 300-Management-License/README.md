# License Management

## 🔥 Scenario

Your customer is running a application(based on a COTS product). They run this application only when needed by the business users and turn them off when not in use.
The COTS product uses a licensing model that ties to the number of machines running its software. Your customer wants to reduce wastage of licenses allocated to the terminated machine.

They want you to propose a solution that will  deallocate licenses from the machines that are about to be terminated. At this moment there is not set pattern on when the machines will be terminated by business users.

## 📋 Next Steps

1. What actions will you take?
1. How will you test your solution?
1. Can you automate its deployment and improve its re-usability as a bonus feature?
